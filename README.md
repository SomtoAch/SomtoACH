# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Nottingham with a strong passion for Python, particularly leveraging the Pandas library for data analysis. My academic and extracurricular interests span Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and C++.

One of my key projects is a **Machine Learning Football Match Attendance Predictor**, where I utilized Selenium, Pandas, and SciKit-Learn to scrape and process a comprehensive dataset of 6,000 football matches, teams, and stadiums, ultimately building a Linear Regression Model to predict match attendance.

Outside the classroom, I serve as the **Head of Events** for the University of Nottinghamâ€™s FinTech & Crypto Society and actively participate in football and kickboxing.
